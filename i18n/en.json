    "text1": "Japan has seen a significant increase in the number of foreign residents this year. According to the latest data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan, the number rose by 10.7% to 2.99 million as of July 2023 compared to the previous year. With a declining population, Japan is in need of skilled workers to sustain its economic growth.",
    "text2": "Currently, Japan is opening up vast opportunities for foreign workers, particularly Indonesian citizens, to live and work in the country. Japan strongly hopes that more Indonesians will not only come as workers but also eventually choose Japan as their long-term residence. Indonesians are regarded as honest, hardworking, and fond of Japanese culture.",
    "text3": "Indonesian workers in Japan are employed in various sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. One of the key advantages of working in Japan is the high salary, which reflects the country’s high cost of living. With substantial earnings, workers are able to save more and improve their quality of life.",
    "text4": "In collaboration with a training institute in Jakarta, DPP IKAFT USK 2023–2028 facilitated two Engineering Alumni of USK (particularly fresh graduates) to work in Japan as of January 10, 2024. To prepare Engineering Alumni (especially fresh graduates) for work in Japan, DPP IKAFT USK established JAPAN CAMP. This program is designed to train participants in Japanese language skills, culture, mental readiness, and discipline before they depart for Japan."
